The row header will range from 10 feet to 24 feet with increments on 2 feet in-between each width amount leading to a total of 8 width lengths. The column header will range from 10 feet to 30 feet with a 1 foot in-between each length amount leading to a total of 20 column lengths. Then he would like me to program a table that takes the dimension of length * width for any of the combinations of length and width, to produce a price of the driveway for customers to use.\n",

    "In the boss's assignment I first created a program that displayed driveway costs with a set width of 10 and varying lengths from 10 feet to 30 feet. Then I created a program that would tell the price for the driveway with varying lengths and widths.Then I created a sort of memory bank for all the driveway length, width, and cost values as a memory storage. Then I created a program that could tell customers how much money they needed to afford a driveway if they had too little. How much they'd have leftover if they had too much money. And how much they could afford if they had a budget between the smallest and largest driveway costs."
