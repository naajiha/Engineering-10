    "I have been asked to work at engineering construction company(ECC) with national home construction company(NHCC) as my client. ECC wants to work with NHCC to build driveways for Home Constructors across the country. My company ECC cares about the environment so we prefer concrete driveways to asphalt driveways. The concrete driveways should be used because concrete is more envionmentally friendly, durable, longer lasting and the most customizable in comparison to asphalt. The driveway must have the dimensions 30 feet by 20 feet by 4 inches(.33 feet). The concrete driveway will be made out of the standard basic ingredients, aggregate, sand, gravel, cement. There will be no premade concrete mix as my boss has requested me to plan for usage of standard ingredients."

    "For this project, I will first need to research the pros and cons of concrete and see what meterials are needed to make concrete. I also need to research whether or not I will be using premade concrete or concrete made from basic ingredients. Then I need to calculate how much of each I would need. Then I will need to research the cost of each of the ingredients for premade concrete and concrete from basic ingredients. Then depending on all these factors I will decide which one is the most cost effective and efficient concrete decision to make."
